## Migration Execution

### AWS Database Migration Service

- Also known as *AWS DMS*
- Managed migration and replication service for databases
- Migrate from legacy or on-premises databases and data warehouses to managed cloud services.
- Minimal downtime and zero data loss.
- üìù Can do:
  - **Full Load:** One-time complete data migration
  - **Change Data Capture (CDC):** Ongoing replication of changes after initial migration
  - **Full Load + CDC:** Complete migration followed by continuous synchronization
- Supported directions:
  - **Cloud to cloud**
    - E.g. you can stream to [Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](./06-03-02-data-analytics-streaming-kinesis-data-firehose-kafka-flink.md#amazon-kinesis-data-streams) through AWS Database Migration Service
  - **On-premises to cloud**
    - You can migrate SQL databases
      - üí° Instead: native SQL DB migration through `.bak` file is recommended.
      - üí° Only recommended if your database cannot be offline while back-up is created/copied and restored.
  - **On-premises to on-premises**
    - E.g. upgrade a minor version with on-prem SAP ASE to on-prem SAP ASE
- Migration products:
  - From:
    - ***On-premises/EC2/Azure***: Oracle, SQL Server, Azure SQL, PostreSQL, MySQL, SAP ASE, MongoDB, S3, DB2
    - ***AWS Native***: [RDS](./06-02-01-data-databases-rds.md) & [Aurora](./06-02-03-data-databases-aurora.md) & S3
  - To:
    - ***AWS-native***: [RDS](./06-02-01-data-databases-rds.md), S3, DynamoDB, Redshift, Kinesis Data Streams, Elasticsearch, DocumentDB
    - ***On-premises/EC2***: Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SAP ASE
- Examples:
  - Oracle to Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition
  - MySQL to RDS for MySQL
  - Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition
  - MongoDB to DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
  - Oracle to Redshift and S3
- **Schema Conversion Tool**
  - E.g. from NoSQL to SQL, SQL to NoSQL or NoSQL to NoSQL.
- Supports SSL connections for both source and target endpoints
  - Certificates managed through DMS console or API
- **Data Extractor**:
  - Runs on-prem, pulls data from DB, uploads to S3 so other DBs can pull it from S3.
- üí° Other use-cases:
  - Classic to VPC
  - Data warehouse to Redshift
  - Consolidate shards into [Aurora](./06-02-03-data-databases-aurora.md)
  - Archive old data, migrate from NoSQL <=> SQL or NoSQL <=> NoSQL.
- **Pricing**
  - Ingress into AWS Database Migration Service is free
  - Egress to [RDS](./06-02-01-data-databases-rds.md) and EC2 in same AZ is also free.

### AWS Application Migration Service

- Simplifies application migration and modernization
- Can help migrate e.g. SAP, Oracle, SQL server, VMware vSphere, Hyper-V
- Supports both third-party/AWS to AWS and on-premises to AWS migrations
- Helps migrate EC2 across regions, AZ or accounts.
- Features:
  - Set-up cross-region DR
  - Convert Windows MS-SQL BYOL to AWS licenses
  - Upgrade Windows Server versions
- ü§ó Successor to *AWS SMS (AWS Server Migration Service)* [DISCONTINUED 2022]

### AWS App2Container

- CLI tool for migrating and modernizing Java and .NET apps to container format.
- Analyzes and builds an inventory of apps running in bare metal / VMS / EC / cloud
- Helps migrating and modernizing legacy applications
- Provides
  - CloudFormation required for compute, network and security.

### AWS DataSync

- Fully managed data transfer service.
- üìù Automates and accelerates moving data between on-premises and AWS.
- Can copy data between NFS shares, SMB shares, HDFS, S3, AWS Snowcone, EFS, FsX
- **Sources:**
  - On-premises: NFS, SMB/CIFS file systems
  - AWS:
    - [S3](./06-01-01-data-s3-overview.md)
    - [EFS](./05-01-06-compute-ec2-ebs-efs-instance-store.md#amazon-elastic-file-system)

  - **Other clouds**: GCP, Azure, Oracle, DigitalOcean, Wasabi, Backblaze, Cloudflare.
- **Destinations:** AWS storage services (S3, EFS, FSx)
- üí° Common Use Cases:
  - Data migration to AWS (lift-and-shift)
  - Disaster recovery and backup
  - Data lake ingestion
  - Hybrid workflows (keeping on-premises and AWS in sync)
- **Task Modes:**
  - **Enhanced mode**:
    - S3-to-S3, other clouds-to-S3 transfers

  - **Enhanced mode**: Agent-less transfers from other clouds with higher performance
  - **Scheduling**: One-time or recurring transfers
  - **Bandwidth throttling**: Control network usage during transfers
  - **Data integrity**: Built-in verification and retry mechanisms
  - **Encryption**: In-transit and at-rest encryption
  - **Incremental transfers**: Only copies changed data after initial sync
  - **Manifests**: Specify exact files/objects to transfer (useful for large datasets)
- **Agent Deployment:**
  - **Enhanced mode**: No agent required for cloud-to-AWS transfers
  - **Basic mode**: Agent required for on-premises and some cloud transfers
  - **AWS-to-AWS**: No agent required
  - **Agent specs**: VMware ESXi, KVM, Hyper-V, or EC2 instance (‚â•m5.2xlarge)
- üí° More cost-effective than running custom scripts or third-party tools for large-scale data transfers
