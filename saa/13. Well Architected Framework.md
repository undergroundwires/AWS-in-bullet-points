# Well Architecture Framework

## 5 pillars of Well Architected Framework

- Not something to balance, or trade-offs, they're a synergy
  - Help you track your performance and evolve your architecture.
- 5 pillars summary:
  1. **Operational Excellence**
     - **Description**: Run and monitor systems & continually improve supporting processes and procedures
     - **Design principles**
       - **Perform operations as code**: Infrastructure as Code
       - **Annotate documentation**: e.g. auto-document after every build)*
       - **Make frequent, small, reversible changes**
       - **Refine operations procedures frequently**: Ensure team members are familiar with it.
       - **Anticipate failure**: Learn from all operational failures
     - **Example AWS Services**
       - **Selection**: Auto Scaling, Lambda, EBS, S3, RDS
       - **Review**: AWS CloudFormation, [AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/)
       - **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, Lambda
       - **Tradeoffs**: Amazon RDS (vs Aurora), ElastiCache (read performance but stale), Snowball (a lot of data but takes a week), CloudFront (cache but stale)
  2. **Security**
     - **Description**: Protect information, systems, and assets through risk assessments and mitigation strategies
     - **Design principles**
       - **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Least privilege, IAM, centralize privilege management, eliminate reliance on long-term credentials
       - **Enable traceability**: Automatically respond to logs and metrics.
       - **Apply security at all layers**: Every instance, OS, and app, e.g. VPC, subnet, LB.
       - **Automate security best practices**: Encryption, tokenization, and access control.
       - **Protect data in transit and at rest**
       - **Keep people away from data**: Reduce the need for direct access or manual data processing
       - **Prepare for security**: Run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery
     - **Example AWS Services**
     - **Identity and access management**: IAM, AWS-STS, MFA token, AWS Organizations
     - **Detective controls**: AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CLoudWatch
     - **Infrastructure Protection**
       - **Amazon CloudFront**: Defense against DDoS attack
       - Amazon VPC
       - **AWS Shield**: DDoS protection of AWS account
       - **AWS WAF**: Web Application Firewall
       - **Amazon Inspector**: for security of EC2 instance
     - **Data protection**: KMS, S3 (SSE, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, bucket policies etc.)
       - And other managed services such as Elastic Load Balancing (e.g. only HTTPS), Amazon EBS & RDS (SSL Capability)
     - **Incident Response**
       - **IAM**: Delete account or give it zero privilege
       - **CloudFormation**: If someone deletes entire structure, how to get back?
       - Amazon CloudWatch Events
  3. **Reliability**
     - **Description**:
       - Ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
       - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
       - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
     - **Design principles**
       - **Test recovery producers**: Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before
       - **Automatically recover from failure**: Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur.
       - **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability**: Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don't share a common point of failure
       - **Stop guessing capacity**: Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning, use auto-scaling.
       - **Manage change in automation**: Use automation to make changes to infrastructure
     - **Example AWS Services**
       - **Foundations**
         - **IAM**: No one has too many rights to damage
         - Amazon VPC
         - **Service limits**: monitor limits so you don't get disruption.
         - **AWS Trusted Advisor**: e.g. look at service limits
       - **Change Management**: AWS Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config
       - **Failure Management**: Backups, AWS CloudFormation (recreate whole infrastructure at once), Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier, Amazon Route 53 (e.g. if application fails you redirect to another application)
  4. **Performance**
     - **Description**: Adopt & provide best performance
     - **Design principles**
       - Democratize advanced technologies *(track new services)*
       - Go global in minutes *(easy multi-region deployment)*
       - Use serverless architectures *(avoid burden of managing servers)*
       - Experiment more often *(easy to carry out comparative testing)*
       - Mechanical sympathy *(be aware of all AWS services)*
     - **Example AWS Services**
       - **Prepare**: AWS CloudFormation, AWS Config
       - **Operate**: AWS CloudFormation, AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray
       - **Evolve**: AWS CloudFormation, CI/CD: CodeBuild, CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline
  5. **Cost Optimization**
     - **Description**: Can run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
     - **Design Principles**
       - **Adopt a consumption mode**: Pay only for what you use
       - **Measure overall efficiency**: Use CloudWatch
       - **Analyze and attribute expenditure**: Use tags, Accurate identification of system usage and costs -> helps measure return on investment (ROI)
       - **Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership**: As managed services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction or service
     - **Example AWS Services**
       - **Expenditure awareness**: AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report, AWS Cost Explorer, Reserved Instance Reporting
       - **Cost-effective resources**: Spot instance, Reserved instance, Amazon S3 Glacier
       - **Matching supply and demand**: AWS Auto Scaling, AWS Lambda
       - **Optimizing over time**: AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Cost and Usage Report, [AWS News Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/)

## Well Architected Tool

- [Tool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected)
- Flow:
  1. Define a workload
  2. Do a review
     - Answer questions for each pillar.
     - E.g. for operational excellence
       - Question: How do you determine what your priorities are?
       - Answers: customer needs / compliance requirements / ... / none
  3. Optionally generate reports, milestones, improvement plans (with risks, e.g. "understand business needs").
