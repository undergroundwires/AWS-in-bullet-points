# Queues

## Patterns of communication

- Two patterns of communication:
  - **Synchronous** (application to application)
    - Can be problematic if there's sudden spikes of traffic
      - E.g. if you need to suddenly encode 1000 videos but it's 10?
    - Better to decouple your application with queues for scalability and resiliency.
  - **Asynchronous / Event based** (application to queue to application)
    - Decouples applications
    - Services can scale independently from applications
    - 💡 **Exactly-once delivery**
      - One of the hardest things to achieve in distributed systems.
      - Better to design your applications to be **idempotent**: not to be affected adversely when processing the same message more than once.

## Comparison

- **SQS vs SNS**
  - Choose SNS for if e.g. someone uploads picture and listeners need to different stuff (send thank you email, crop thumbnail & save in S3).
  - Choose SQS for application to application communication.
  - **Fan out**: SNS to SQS to listeners = good of both worlds.
- **SQS** vs **SNS** vs **Kinesis Streams** vs **Amazon MQ**

  | Attribute | **SQS Standard** | **SQS FIFO** | **SNS** | **Kinesis Streams** | **Amazon MQ** |
  | --------- |:----------------:|:------------:|:-------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
  | **Type** | Direct queue | Direct queue | Pub & Sub (with topics) | Data ingestion | Direct queue + topic |
  | **Consumption** | Pull | Pull | Push | Pull | Pull + Push |
  | **Latency** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐☆ | ⭐☆☆ | ⭐⭐⭐  | ⭐⭐⭐ |
  | **FIFO** | 👎 Best effort | 👍 FIFO | 👎 Best effort | 👍 Per partition key | 👍 Supports FIFO |
  | **Delivery** | 👎 At-least-once | 👍 Exactly-Once Processing | 👎 At-least-once | 👍 Per partition key | 👍 Supports FIFO |
  | **Retention** | 14 days, default: 4 | 14 days, default: 4 | None | 1 day (default), up to 7 days | Persisted in file until configured max file size reached |
  | **Throughput / limits** | None | 300 transactions per second per API | Max topics / subscribers | Write/read per shard, can scale out shards. | Requires provisioning eg `mq.t2.micro`. Users, brokers, configurations and data storage is limited. API is throttled. |
  | **Can delay** | ✓ | ✓ | ✕ | ✕ | ✕ Only on redelivery |
  | **Out of box dead letter queue** | ✓ | ✓ | ✕ | ✕ | ✓ |
  | **AWS integrations** | 👍 Many | 👎 Missing many e.g. S3/CloudWatch/SNS/Lambda DLQ... | 👍 Many | 👌 Some: Data Firehose, S3, Kinesis Data Analytics, Lambda, SDK uses DynamoDB for checkpoints | 👎 Almost none, requires code. |
  | **Consumer type** | Same type | Same type | Different consumers can be different stuff with the event from the topic | Can be different per partition, as same consumer can listen to same partition | Can be same (direct queue) or different (topics) |
  | **Use cases** | Fast, decouple/integrate apps, visibility time out, message level ack/fail, message delay. | SQS + strict ordering, deduplication, decouple/integrate apps | Pub & sub (1 event to different apps), emails/SMS/.., push notifications, fan out (SNS to SQS -> good of both) | Analytics, logs, IoT.. Related records to same processor (partitioning), ordering, multiple apps to consume same stream concurrently, consume records a few hours later. | Lift & shift |

## Other services

- **Amazon MSK**: Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
- **AWS IoT**: Bi-directional communication between Internet-connected devices such as sensors, actuators, embedded micro-controllers, or smart appliances and the AWS Cloud.
