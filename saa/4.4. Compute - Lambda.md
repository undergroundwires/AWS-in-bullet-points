# AWS Lambda

## Serverless introduction

- Cloud history: Data Centre => IaaS (EC2, 2016) => PaaS => Containers => Serverless
- Concept came up with Faas (Function as a Service) = Lambda
  - Today the definition includes anything that's managed where you developers don't see / provision / manage servers.
  - In AWS: Lambda & Step Functions, DynamoDB, AWS Cognito, AWS API Gateway, S3, SNS & SQS, Kinesis, Aurora Serverless...
- Serverless application examples:
  - Users *->* Rest API *->* API Gateway *->* Lambda *->* DynamoDB with log in function from Amazon Cognito.
  - Serverless thumbnail creation
    - User uploads image to S3
    - S3 triggers lambda function to create a thumbnail
    - Lambda
      - Creates & pushes thumbnail image into S3
      - Saves metadata in DynamoDB

## Lambda

- **Lambda vs EC2**

  | EC2 | Lambda |
  |-----|--------|
  | Virtual servers in the cloud  | Virtual functions -> no servers to manage! |
  | Limited by RAM and CPU | Limited by time - short executions |
  | Continuously running | Run on-demand |
  | Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers | Scaling is automated |

- **Pricing**
  1. Pay per **calls**.
  2. Pay per **duration** (in increment of 100ms)
     - E.g. you get 400.000 GBs of FREE compute time
       - = 400.000 seconds if function is 1 GB RAM
       - = 3.200.000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
- **Integrations**
  - Almost whole AWS Stack can trigger it: API Gateway, Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3, AWS IoT, CloudWatch Events, CloudWatch Logs, AWS SNS, AWS Cognito, Amazon SQS and more.
- Can use different programming languages: Node.js (JavaScript), Python, Java, C# (.NET CORE), Golang, C# / PowerShell, C++ and more.
- Lambda like EC2 and ECS supports hyper-threading on one or more virtual CPUs.
- **Lambda@Edge** lets you run lambda functions in edge locations.
- ***Blueprint***s are code templates for writing Lambda functions.
- You can test lambdas directly on portal by configuring & sending ***test event***s in the Console
- **Security**
  - ***IAM role*** must be attached to it.
  - Deployed within a **VPC** as default.
    - To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC:
      - Give subnet IDs and security group IDs
      - Lambda uses those IDs to set up ENIs.
    - AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC.
    - 💡 In your subnet you need enough available IP / ENI's otherwise you get `EC2ThrottledException` for concurrent execution.
  - Lambda can have **Security Groups**.
  - Auditing and compliance through ***CloudTrail*** logging.
- **Configurations**
  - **Timeout**: Default 3 seconds, 📝max of 15 minutes
    - Function fails directly after timeout
  - Environment variables that can be accessed directly from the code.
  - **Allocated memory** (128MB to 10 GB)
    - 💡 Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network!
    - 📝Scaling is automated.
  - **Lambda DLQ**
    - Debugging and error handling through dead letter queues
    - Can be SNS or [SQS queue](./10.1.1.%20Integrations%20-%20Queues%20-%20SQS.md#dead-latter-queue-dlq)
  - **Encryption**
    - Encryption helpers to pass secure credentials in an encrypted manner.
    - Prevents other developer who has access to console from seeing the credentials.
- **Scaling**
  - ❗ Concurrency limits how many lambda functions can be executed simultaneously.
    - For initial burst between 500-3000 depending on region.
    - Later: 500 per minute until limit is reached.
    - Concurrency limit starts from 1000 (soft limit)
- 💡 Architectures can get complicated -> AWS X-ray allows you to debug what's happening.
  - Trace and analyse keywords.
- ❗📝 Limitations
  - RAM: Up to 10GB
  - **Deployment**
    - **Max size** 250 MB or 50 MB (zipped)
      - 💡 Overcome limit: use `/tmp` directory to load other files at startup
    - **Size of environment variables**: 4 KB
  - **Execution**
    - **Memory allocation**: 128 MB - 10 GB (64 MB increments)
    - **Maximum execution time**: 15 minutes
    - **Disk capacity** in the "function container" (in `/tmp`): 512 MB
    - **Concurrency limits**: 1000 (soft limit)
