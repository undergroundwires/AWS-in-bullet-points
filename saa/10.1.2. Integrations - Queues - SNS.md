# Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

- SNS has pub/sub model
- Event producer only sends message to one topic
- As many event receivers (subscriptions) as we want to listen
- Different from SQS where you have direct integration between listeners & senders.
- **Retention**: ❗ You have to process the data right away or it's lost
- Flow
- ***Event producer*** publish messages to a ***SNS topic***
  - ❗ Up to 100.000 topics (soft limit)
- ***Subscriptions*** listen a specific ***SNS topic***
  - ❗ Up to 10.000.000 subscriptions per topic (soft limit)
  - Each subscriber get all the messages but can filter.
- **Subscribers** can be
  - SQS
  - HTTP/HTTPS (with delivery retries)
  - Lambda
  - Emails, SMS messages, Mobile Notifications
- High availability with managed replication to 3 AZ.
- Pay as you go pricing
- **Integrations**: SNS integrates with a lot of Amazon Services
- Some services can send data directly to SNS for notifications
- E.g. CloudWatch for alarms, Auto Scaling Groups notifications, Amazon S3 on bucket events CloudFormation (upon state changes => failed to build etc.) ...
- Publish types
  - **Topic Publish** (within your AWS server - using the SDK)
    1. Create a topic
    2. Create a subscription (or many)
    3. Publish to the topic
  - **Direct Publish** (for mobile apps SDK)
    1. Create a platform application
    2. Create a platform endpoint
    3. Publish to the platform endpoint
       - Works with Google GCM, Apple APNS, Amazon ADM
- 📝**Fan out (SNS -> SQS)**
  - Push once in SNS, receive in many SQS
    - E.g. *Buying Service -> SNS Topic ->
      1. SQS Queue 1 (-> Fraud service)
      2. SQS Queue 2 (-> Shipping service)
  - Good because:
    - 💡 No data loss (in SNS you need to handle message right away)
    - Ability to add receivers later
    - SQS allows for delayed processing and retries of work
    - May have many workers on one queue and one worker on the other queue
    - In only SQS a message is not guaranteed to be delivered to all consumers
    - Ability to add receivers later
