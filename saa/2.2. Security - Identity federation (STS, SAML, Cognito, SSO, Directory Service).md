# Identity federation & SSO

- Federation lets users outside of AWS to assume temporary role (using STS) for accessing AWS resources without having to create a user in AWS.
- Federation assumes a form of 3rd party authentication e.g. LDAP, Microsoft Active Directory (=~ SAML), SSO, Open ID, Cognito
  - Single Sign On
  - Open ID
  - Cognito

## AWS STS - Security Token Service

- Allows to grant limited and temporary access (permissions) to AWS resources
- Token is valid for between 15 minutes to one hour (must be refreshed)
- Used mostly for:
  - Generates tokens when assuming roles.
  - ***Cross Account Access*** that allows users from one AWS account access resources in another
    - ***Flow***
      1. Define an IAM role for another account to access
      2. Define which accounts can access this IAM role
      3. Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM role you have access to (`AssumeRole` API)
  - ***Federation (Active Directory)***
    - Provides a non-AWS user with temporary AWS access by linking users Active Directory credentials
    - Uses SAML (Security Assertion markup language)
    - Allows Single Sign On (SSO) which enables users to log in to AWS console without assigning IAM credentials
  - ***Federation with third party providers (Cognito & Web Identity Federation)***
    - Cognito: Used mainly in web and mobile applications
    - Web Identity Federation: Makes use of Facebook/Google/Amazon etc. to federate them

## Federation

- STS is common service to create credentials after identity validation
  - Identity validation can be  done through SAML, Cognito or Custom Identity Broker application.

### SAML based federation

- To integrate Active Directory / ADFS with AWS (or any SAML 2.0)
- An **IdP** authenticates on on-prem store and then exchanges **SAML assertion** that has roles with STS to get a redirect URL with token.

### Custom Identity Broker Application

- 💡 Use only if identity provider is not compatible with SAML 2.0
- You have to program ***Identity Broker*** that must determine the appropriate IAM policy.

## AWS Cognito

- Managed identity broker for web identity federation
- **User pools**
  - Handles registration, authentication, account recovery.
  - Synchronizes user data for your users, username etc.
    - Uses Push Synchronization to & SNS to push updates to sync data across multiple devices.
  - Includes JWT tokens from third party authentication providers.
- **Identity Pools**
  - User directory for clients.
  - Allows users to obtain temporary AWS credentials to access AWS resources.
  - Flow
    - User logs into federated identity provider & gets *third party authentication token*.
    - Send *third party authentication* token to Cognito
      - Cognito returns Cognito ID with temporary AWS credentials
  - E.g. Provide (temporary) access to write to S3 bucket using Facebook Login
  - 💡 Good for authenticating B2B & B2C users for web + mobile applications.
- **Web Identity Federation**
  - An alternative to Cognito
  - ❗ AWS recommends Web Identity Federation only for advanced scenarios.
  - 💡 Mostly try to use Cognito, because it does most of the behind-the-scenes work with public identity provider services for you.

## AWS Single Sign On (SSO)

- Centrally Managed Single Sign On across multiple AWS Accounts and Business Applications (Office 365, SalesForce, Box)
- One login gets you access to management console securely
- Integrated with Microsoft Active Directory
- Only helpful for Web Browser, SAML 2.0 enabled applications.
  - E.g. IdP (Identity Provider) initiated single sign on

## Cognito vs SSO

- Amazon Cognito
  - Customer-targeted IAM and user directory solution.
  - For customers/developers building B2C or B2B apps for their customers
- Amazon SSO
  - Focused on SSO for employees accessing AWS and business apps

## AWS Directory Service

- **AWS managed Active Directory**
- 💡 Use cases
  - Can use it as an actual Microsoft Active Directory
  - Easily migrate directory-aware, on-premises workloads
  - Easily extend existing domains
  - 💡 Choose to integrate with on-prem ID if you don't want to setup federation / SAML infrastructure for SSO
- Integrations
  - SSO with corporate credentials to e.g. WorkSpaces, WorkDocs, or WorkMail.
  - AD-aware EC2 instances, RDS SQL etc.
- **AD Connector**
  - Directory gateway to redirect directory requests to on-premises AD without caching any information in the cloud.
  - Eliminates the need for directory synchronization and the cost and complexity of hosting a federation infrastructure.
  - Enforce on-prem policies in cloud.
  - Use existing MFA infrastructure for MFA.
- **Simple Active Directory**
  - Standalone managed directory.
  - Subset of features from Microsoft AD based Directory Service.
  - Easier to manage Linux
