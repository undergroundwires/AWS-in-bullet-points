# Elastic Beanstalk

- Developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS.
- Manages infrastructure for the code by making following very easy:
  - Configuration of databases
  - Configuration of load balancers
  - Configuration of auto-scaling
- Instance / OS configuration / deployment is handled by Beanstalk but are configurable.
- **Pricing**: Elastic BeanStalk is free! You pay for the underlying resources.
- It deploys common HA architectures with EC2, ALB, ASG, RDS, etc..
  1. **Single instance deployments**: good for dev
  2. **LB + ASG**: good for prod + pre-production
  3. **ASG only**: good for non-web apps in production (workers, etc.)
- Still have full control over the configuration
- Support for many platforms: Go, Java SE, Java with Tomcat, .NET on Windows Server with IIS, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Packer Builder, Single Container Docker, multi-container Docker, Preconfigured Docker
- Deployment:
  - Has three components:
    - Application
    - Application version (increased in each deployment)
    - Environment name e.g. dev, test, prod.
  - You deploy application versions to environments can promote application versions to the next environment.
  - Rollback feature to previous application version
  - Full control over lifecycle of environments
  - If not supported, you can write your custom platform (advanced)
- Can run containers:
  - **Single Container Docker**: 1 container per Beanstalk instance.
  - **Multi-container Docker**: Many docker instances within same Beanstalk instance.
  - **Preconfigured Docker Containers**: e.g. *Java with Glassfish* or *Python with uWSGI*.
- **Configurations**
  - **Presets**
    - **Low cost** (free tier eligible): One EC2 + Elastic IP
    - **High availability**: ELB + ASG
    - **Custom configuration**: Customize everything
  - **Software**
    - Environment (e.g. NodeJs) version and environment properties
    - AWS X-Ray enabled/disabled
    - Rotate logs (disabled/enabled)
    - Log streaming (disabled/enabled)
  - **Instances**
    - Instance type, image ID, root volume type, root volume size, root volume IOPS, security groups
  - **Capacity**
    - Environment type (e.g. load balancing, auto-scaling)
    - Availability zones
    - Instances
  - **Load balancer**: type, listener (e.g. 1), processes (e.g. 1), rules (e.g. 1)
  - **Rolling updates and deployments**
    - Deployment policy (e.g. all at once)
    - Rolling updates (disabled/enabled)
    - Health check(enabled/disabled)
  - **Security**
    - Service role (e.g. `aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role`)
    - VM key pair
    - VM instance profile.
  - **Monitoring**
    - Health reporting system (enhanced)
    - Ignore HTTP 4xx *(disabled/enabled)*
    - Health event log streaming *(disabled/enabled)*
  - **Managed updates** *(enabled/disabled)*
  - **Notifications** with e.g. (email address)
  - **Network**: VPC
  - **Database**: engine, instance class, storage (GB), multi-AZ)
